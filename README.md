# Python-Based Slot Machine Analytics

---
## Overview

This is a simulation-based project that integrates gameplay, database persistence, analytics, and automated reporting into a complete end-to-end pipeline. It’s about showcasing **how simulations can generate real-time data that is later stored, analyzed, visualized, and transformed into professional reports**. Here outcomes are logged into a database, analyzed with Python libraries, and finally converted into a polished PDF report with visual insights.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎮 **Simulation Engine** – Runs slot machine spins with configurable symbols & payouts.  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage (SQLite)** – Automatically logs every spin result for historical analysis.  
- 📊 **Data Analytics (Pandas)** – Provides insights into wins/losses, trends, and cumulative performance.  
- 📈 **Visualizations (Matplotlib)** – Graphs to illustrate session outcomes and long-term statistics.  
- 📑 **Automated Reporting (FPDF)** – Generates polished PDF reports with stats and charts.  
- 🖥️ **Optional GUI (Tkinter/PyQt)** – Interactive play mode (work in progress).

## 📂 Project Structure

├── simulation_engine.py   # Slot machine simulation + DB logging
├── analytics_report.py    # Data analytics + PDF report generator
├── simulation_results.db  # SQLite database (auto-created)
├── simulation_report.pdf  # Generated PDF report
└── README.md              # Project documentation

## Workflow

1. Run the simulation engine (simulation_engine.py) to play multiple games and store results in the database.
2. Load results in analytics_report.py to analyze outcomes, generate visualizations, and create a professional PDF report.
3. The PDF report (simulation_report.pdf) combines data from all runs, allowing clear insight into performance trends over time.

## ▶️ How to Run
 ### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/slot-machine-analytics.git
cd slot-machine-analytics

### 2️⃣ Run the Simulation Engine
python simulation_engine.py

This will simulate games and log results into simulation_results.db.

### 3️⃣ Generate Analytics Report
python analytics_report.py

This will create a PDF report named: **simulation_report.pdf**

## Example Output

> Session results stored in simulation_results.db
> Trend graphs of winnings vs. losses
> Automated PDF reports summarizing performance

## Future Enhancements

 1. Live dashboard with Streamlit/Flask.
 2. Add ML models for prediction on outcomes.
 3. Auto-generate report after each simulation run.
